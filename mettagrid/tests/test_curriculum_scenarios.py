"""
Test suite for curriculum algorithm scenarios using the new TaskTree system.

This module tests specific scenarios to validate that curriculum algorithms
behave correctly under controlled conditions using the TaskTree architecture.

Progressive Algorithm Tests:
1. Monotonic linear signal -> should advance through tasks correctly
2. Always 0 signal -> should stay on first task
3. Random signal -> should still progress with right parameters

Learning Progress Algorithm Tests:
4. Mixed impossible/learnable tasks -> should weight learnable evenly, ignore impossible
5. Threshold dependency -> should first weight primary, then secondary after milestone

Prioritize Regressed Algorithm Tests:
6. All tasks have linear scaling -> should maintain equal distribution
7. One impossible task (always 0) -> should get minimum weight as max_score = 0 ==> LP = epsilon
